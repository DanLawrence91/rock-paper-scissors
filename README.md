# Rock, Paper, Scissors

## Description

- The aim of this project was to build a rock, paper, scissors game using javascript. The user would be asked to select one of rock, paper or scissors. 
The computer would then select one of these options randomly. The User would be alerted to what the computer had chosen. Based on which selection both 
user and computer made would decide whether the user won, lost or tied.

- After the selections have been made there is a new alert that shows stats for how the user has done and they are asked whether they would like to play
again. If they select yes a new game starts, if no then it does not.

## Future Features

- The website can be improved through adding CSS and some more HTML to have a better looking webpage.
